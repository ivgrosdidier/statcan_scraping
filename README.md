# statcan_scraping
The goal of this project was to scrape demographic information for each FSA in 3 provinces of interest (Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan). The script returns a dataframe of every FSA along with information on whether the FSA is in a rural or small/medium/large urban area, and population statistics for each FSA.
